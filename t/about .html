        <p>
            My name is Shantanu Parmar, and I am an undergraduate Engineering student pursuing a Bachelor's in Technology in Information and Communication Technology at Marwadi University. I am an American Physical Society Matching Membership Fellow and a member of the Inspired 24 Space Initiative. My research interests lie at the intersection of Astrophysics, Machine Learning, and VLSI. In my free time, I enjoy astrophotography, hiking, and building electronics projects.
